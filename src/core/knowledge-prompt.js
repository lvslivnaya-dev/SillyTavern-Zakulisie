/**
 * The "who knows what" block for the narrator model.
 *
 * Only the characters of the coming scene (on stage, plus anyone the last
 * messages mention) get lines, so the block stays small however long the chat
 * is. Negative knowledge is the point: a model reliably over-uses what it sees
 * in the chat, so the block says plainly who does NOT know what, and who has not
 * met whom.
 *
 * Line kinds (the preview groups by these prefixes):
 *   scene:                  who is present, where
 *   strangers[A & B]:       never met — names, history unknown
 *   seen[A & B]:            met, names still unknown
 *   unknown[A]:             events A did not witness and was not told
 *   heard[A]:               events A knows only second-hand (told / rumour)
 *   secret[A]:              lorebook secrets A knows, with their text
 *   dead[A]:                A has died (how and when, if noted); the mentioned dead first
 *
 * A lorebook secret (event.lore) is sent only while someone of the scene knows
 * it: then they get its text and the others an unknown[] line. When nobody on
 * stage knows, the model hears nothing about it, so it has nothing to hint at.
 *
 * The budget is spent in that order of importance; inside a character's line
 * secrets come first, then the newest events.
